## Description
I used to always forget important things, but then I learned to organize everything by creating a reliable place to store those hard to remember items. Now I'm the most efficient granny around, and I can help you whippersnappers clear your mind-clutter and do the same! **Ethel** is not just an ordinary granny, or an ordinary list making application. Sure, you can create lists, sort them into categories and easily add and remove items, but you can also share lists with other people and collaborate instantly. 

Left your grocery list under the fridge magnet? Mobile-first development means your lists are right at home on your phone, and more importantly always with you. Want to know what items your partner or roommate just picked up from 5 aisles over? Share and work off the same list in the store, in real time. Need a place to share movie recommendations, gift ideas or party planning to-dos? Ethel's got you covered.
